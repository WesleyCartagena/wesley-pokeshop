 ## About The Project

I built this project to put my development skills to the test and try to build a mockup e-commerce shop using the Poke API. I had a lot of fun creating this project. The project only uses React and Bootstrap as it is strictly a frontend project. There is no backend associated with it, but there will be in the future.

 ### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
